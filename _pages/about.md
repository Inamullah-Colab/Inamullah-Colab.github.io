I am **Inamullah**, a PhD student in Computer Science at the [School of Electronics and Computer Science](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/about/faculties-schools-departments/school-of-electronics-and-computer-science), [University of Southampton](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/). My research aims to understand how the **retinal microvasculature reflects systemic biological processes**, and how signals observed in the eye relate to complex interactions across genetics, molecular profiles, and clinical phenotypes.

The retina provides a unique, non-invasive window into human physiology. Beyond its local structure, the retinal vasculature encodes information linked to cardiovascular regulation, metabolic function, neurovascular integrity, and developmental biology. My work seeks to characterise these relationships by analysing fine-grained retinal features—such as vessel calibre, tortuosity, density, and fractal patterns- and studying how they connect to **clinical variables, multi-omics profiles (including lipidomics), and genetic data**.

A central focus of my research is not only identifying associations, but **understanding the mechanisms and pathways that give rise to them**. To this end, I develop and apply **mathematical and statistical frameworks** that are capable of capturing latent structure, mediation effects, and confounding influences commonly found in high-dimensional biomedical data. These include correlation-based and causal modelling approaches, multivariate regression, network analysis, and interpretable machine learning methods designed to disentangle direct, indirect, and shared biological effects.

By integrating retinal imaging with genetic variation, molecular traits, and clinical measurements, my research explores how information flows across biological scales, from genotype and molecular regulation to vascular morphology and observable clinical risk. This enables the investigation of **pathway-level interactions, regulatory networks, and mediated relationships**, rather than treating each data modality in isolation.

This work aligns closely with the emerging field of **oculomics**, which studies ocular biomarkers derived from advanced imaging as indicators of systemic health and disease. My broader interests include multimodal data integration, explainable and trustworthy AI for healthcare, and the development of robust computational methods that support biological interpretability, translational insight, and precision medicine.


Early Career Before Joining Phd
======
My academic and professional journey has been shaped by a combination of diverse training, lived experience, and a long-standing motivation to contribute meaningfully to healthcare-related research.

Before beginning my doctoral studies, I completed a master’s degree in medical imaging, where I developed practical experience in image analysis, computational modeling, and data-driven methods applied to biomedical problems. This work marked a pivotal point in my academic development, as it allowed me to bridge my technical background with my long-standing interest in medical and healthcare applications.

Prior to my master’s studies, I earned a bachelor’s degree with a combined focus on physics, mathematics, and computer science. This interdisciplinary training provided a strong theoretical foundation in analytical thinking, mathematical modelling, and computational problem-solving—skills that continue to underpin my current research approach. Even earlier, I completed a three-year diploma in civil engineering, followed by over two years of professional experience in this field. This early professional exposure instilled in me a strong sense of practical reasoning, structural thinking, and responsibility in real-world settings.

Beyond formal education, my motivation to work in medically relevant research is deeply personal. I come from **Bajaur Agency**, a remote tribal region in Pakistan near the Pakistan–Afghanistan border, where access to basic healthcare services, medical facilities, and medication has historically been extremely limited. Growing up in an environment where medical needs were often unmet shaped my awareness of health inequalities from an early age and fostered a strong desire to contribute—directly or indirectly—to improving health outcomes for underserved populations.

Although unstable circumstances prevented me from pursuing a traditional medical career, this motivation has remained central to my academic direction. Over time, I came to recognise that **computational science, engineering, and data-driven methods** offer powerful alternative pathways to contribute to medicine and healthcare. This realisation led me to progressively integrate my background in physics, mathematics, computer science, engineering, and medical imaging into a coherent research trajectory.

My current PhD research represents the convergence of these experiences. By integrating retinal imaging, clinical data, lipidomics, and genetic information, and by developing mathematical, statistical, and interpretable machine learning methods to model latent, mediated, and confounded biological relationships, my work aims to uncover mechanistic insights into systemic health through non-invasive biomarkers. This approach allows me to engage with medically meaningful problems while contributing methodological rigor and interpretability, an intersection that aligns closely with my long-term interests and values.

Overall, my research path reflects both intellectual curiosity and personal motivation. It brings together diverse technical foundations and a sustained commitment to healthcare-oriented impact, positioning my work at the intersection of **AI, biomedical data science, and translational medical research**.
