    <p style="margin-top:8px;">
      This study provides a systematic analysis of how diversity mechanisms in CNN ensembles address both data imbalance and data scarcity in medical imaging. Through extensive experiments on retinal datasets, the work highlights ensemble design strategies that lead to more stable and generalisable performance in clinical scenarios.
