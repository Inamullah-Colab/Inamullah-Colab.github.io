      This work investigates how architectural and data diversity within CNN-based ensemble models improves robustness when dealing with imbalanced and limited medical imaging datasets. Using diabetic retinopathy as a case study, the proposed ensemble framework demonstrates substantial gains in accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity over conventional approaches.
